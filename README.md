# The PyBrowser Project.
## What is The PyBrowser Project?
The `PyBrowser Project` is a python browser working to make a fully operating python browser. The firefox python browser only had 4 lines of code, and he did not even develop it! he just imported os and did os.system('firefox'), And it got on #1 Trending On Replit! So im trying to make the browswer without os! This uses turtle and tkinter messagebox.
