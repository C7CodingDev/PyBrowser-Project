# The PyBrowser Project.
### What is The `PyBrowser Project`?
The `PyBrowser Project` is a python browser working to make a fully operating python browser. This uses turtle and tkinter messagebox.
### Why did I make the `PyBrowser Project`?
Because The firefox python browser only had 4 lines of code, and he did not even develop it! he just imported os and did os.system('firefox'), And it got on #1 Trending On Replit! So im trying to make the browswer without os firefox!\
**`IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS USES OS SECRETS TO STORE IMPORTANT DATA!!! DO NOT DELETE! THIS WILL CAUSE ERRORS IN THE CODE!`**\
**LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT KNOW `PYTHON TKINTER OR PYTHON TURTLE!`**
